### Hi there, I'm **Bai Zhiyuan** 👋

Hi, I'm BZY, and I'm currently working as an Algorithm Engineer at Hangzhou Guangli Technology Co., Ltd. My main area of research focuses on the development of lightweight Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems (VINS). I've got my Master's degree form the Hangzhou Dianzi University (Control Science and Engineering) @ Summer 2024. During this period, I conduct in-depth research on RFS-SLAM, covering both theoretical and engineering aspects, specifically from GM-PHD-PMAU-SLAM to IEKF-PHD-SLAM with multi-sensor fusion.
And I've got my Bachelor's degree from the Ningbo Tech University (Mechatronic Engineering) @ Summer 2021. Before June 2021, I was dedicated to robotics competitions and co-founded a STEM club, where I learned from the competitions and shared my knowledge with fellow members. In the competitions, I was mainly responsible for the control part of the robot, including motion modeling, cascade PID design, and path planning.

This is the place where I opensource stuff:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on VINS Framework Design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Embedded System Development (C++, Linux).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on VIO.
- 💬 Ask me about SLAM, I'd like to help.
- 📫 How to reach me: bai846@hdu.edu.cn.
